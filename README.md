# Taste of Naija

Taste of Naija is a website built for the first imaginary Nigerian restaurant in Würzburg. The website targets people in and around Würzburg who love African food and those who are curious about how African food tastes.
The website provides useful information about the restaurant such as the address, opening times, contact information and food menu.

    - The main page image displays the 'Naija Jollof' (Nigerian jollof rice) as it is popularly called.
